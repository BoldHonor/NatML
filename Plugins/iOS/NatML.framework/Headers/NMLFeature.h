 When a feature is provided to a model, the model will typically create an 
 input feature, one which has any transformations applied.

 With this function, the input feature is immediately converted to a feature which can be directly 
 consumed by a model, removing the need for any pre-processing.

 Note that the source feature MUST NOT be released before the created input feature.

 @param feature
 Feature to convert to a model input feature.

 Output converted feature.
